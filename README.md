# Record Matching Solution

## Matching Strategy

Our record matching solution implements a probabilistic record linkage approach using Splink combined with custom preprocessing techniques. The strategy incorporates:

1. **Data Standardization**: All text fields are normalized through case standardization (lowercase), whitespace trimming, and consistent formatting.

2. **Phonetic Matching**: We employ Double Metaphone phonetic encoding for first and last names to match similar-sounding names regardless of spelling variations.

3. **Hierarchical Blocking**: To improve efficiency while maintaining match quality, we implemented strategic blocking on critical fields.

4. **Feature Engineering**: We created derived features like full name and email domain to strengthen matching signals.

## Assumptions

- Records may have incomplete fields, but at least basic identifiers (name components) are present
- Names that sound similar are likely to refer to the same person
- Contact information (phone, email) when present is more discriminating than name alone
- Address information provides supporting evidence but may change over time

## Challenge Handling

### Nickname Variations

- **Phonetic Encoding**: Double Metaphone encoding captures phonetic similarities regardless of spelling variations

### Typos and Inconsistent Formatting

- **Standardization Pipeline**: Our preprocessing pipeline normalizes:
  - Case (lowercase for all text fields)
  - Whitespace (stripped from beginning/end)
  - Phone numbers (extracted digits and extensions separately)
  - ZIP codes (consistent 5-digit format)

### Conflicting Data Between Records

- **Field-specific Matching**: Different weights are assigned to various fields with more reliable identifiers given higher importance
- **Composite Scoring**: Final match score combines evidence from multiple fields, allowing matches even when some fields conflict
- **Matching Threshold**: Configurable threshold determines what level of similarity constitutes a match

### Missing Values

- **Null Handling**: The system handles records with missing values by:
  - Using available fields for comparison
  - Implementing conditional comparison logic that adapts to present fields
  - Not penalizing matches when fields are missing in one or both records
- **Completeness Analysis**: Data completeness is analyzed to understand which fields provide most reliable matching signals
- **Email and Phone**: Only ~70% completeness in source data, treated as strong signals when present

###Model Explainability

- Splink is a probabilistic record linkage framework used in our solution to identify matching records across datasets. It implements the Fellegi-Sunter model, which evaluates the likelihood that records refer to the same entity by calculating a match probability based on comparison of field values.

- To make matching computationally feasible, we implemented blocking rules:
    - Hierarchical blocking: Starting with strong identifiers, then progressively relaxing constraints
    - Multi-pass approach: Different blocking combinations to catch matches that might be missed by any single strategy
    - Block analysis: Using Splink's blocking analysis tools to quantify block sizes and ensure efficiency

- Probabilistic Scoring: Each potential match is assigned a probability score based on field-level similarity
